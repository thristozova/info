# Available To Promise

## Overview

**Available to promise or ATP** quantity represents the minimum quantity of a product that your company can offer to a customer and deliver it to that customer without making them wait longer than agreed due to falling short of stock.  

ATP is an inventory management tool for determining the part of the inventory that is available for offering and promising to other customers. 
These portions of the inventory that are already reserved for fulfilling previously placed customer orders are not counted towards ATP, even if they are on hand.  

## Why ATP Is a Crucial Tool for Any Business

Delivering a product before the agreed deadline is one of the most important abilities for any distributor, retailer, or any other supplier.  

When a customer places an order, they normally expect this order to be processed and delivered within a reasonable period. 
Failing to fulfill orders and deliver goods as promised, especially if happening repeatedly, is a sure reason for customers to turn away from one provider and move on to another, resulting in experiencing a reduction in sales volumes.  

Therefore, ATP plays a huge part in enabling you to hold up your end to the delivery agreements made between you and your customers. 
Utilizing a powerful ATP tool ensures your business can meet delivery deadlines and customer expectations by being punctual in product delivery.  

Furthermore, mastering ATP empowers your business to come up with a systematic and sustainable inventory management strategy. 
Such strategy allows you to make the appropriate plans and arrangements, and ultimately cut down order fulfillment and product delivery times.  

All these efforts, when applied properly, increase your company's capabilities for delivering as earlier as possible, making a positive impression on your customers. 
Maintaining healthy customer relationships improves your business's market presence and reputation, which paves the way for returning customers, as well as referrals to new customers.

## How ATP Is Calculated

Calculating Available to promise quantities is based on the Projected available balance.  

Available to promise quantities for any given product are calculated for the present day and for any desired future date(s).  


> [!NOTE]
> **Available to promise** inventory quantities should NOT be mistaken for **Projected available balance**.  
> 
> Available to promise shows only this **inventory portion that remains physically available to offer for sale and delivery**, aside from fulfilling already placed customer orders or serving the company's own necessities.  
> 
> Projected available balance represents **the full inventory amount** that is expected to be physically at hand for any successive future period.  
> 
> Although close in meaning and related in implementation, the two terms still express different concepts.
